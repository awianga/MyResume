    <h1>What I Do When I’m Not Coding</h1>
    <p>When I’m not at my desk, I try to stay active and explore the world—though sometimes the world explores me back.</p>
    <p>Running marathons keeps me disciplined (and occasionally questioning my sanity), while mountain summits remind me how small I am compared to nature.</p>
    <p>I’ve also taken up freediving, where I’ve shared the water with sharks, whales, and the occasional fish that looks like it’s judging my technique. Exploring sunken ships and underwater caves has taught me patience, curiosity, and the importance of not running out of air.</p>
